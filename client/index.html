        <img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" class="image image-full" />
      <p>A high technology company that develops and markets software tools for simulation, computer-aided process design, capacity analysis and production scheduling. Its software tools not only serve the process manufacturing industries but also is a learning tool for teachers and students. </p>
										<p>The concept of building a computer-aided process design technology by the students and for the students as well as the industries was a brainwave of Dr. Rajiv Shekhar and Dr.Seetharaman, professors of Materials Science and Engineering Department in IIT Kanpur. They along with the batch of 90 motivated third year B.Tech students of the 2012 batch developed this software over a period of 4 months starting from January 2015. The company operates under a Board of Directors with Akash Bajaj and Utsav Sadana as the CEO's.</p>
								<p>Our team of budding engineers has done extensive research coupled with hands on experience in the fields of  mineral processing, pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy.We offer a range of innovative solutions for the minerals industry aimed at increasing productivity and metal recovery.</p>
